Here’s a clear and concise `README.md` section for your GitHub repository that describes what your HTML project/demo does:

# 🧠 Auto Redirect for Content Analysis

This project demonstrates an **automatic redirection system** for analyzing text, verifying media, and fact-checking content using trusted third-party services. Instead of offering users multiple options, this tool detects the content type (e.g., text, image, or social media info) and sends the user **directly** to the appropriate platform.

## 🚀 Features

* 🔤 **Text Analysis** → Redirects to [GPTZero](https://gptzero.me/)
* 📰 **Media Bias & Fact Checking** → [MediaBiasFactCheck](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/)
* 🧑‍💻 **Social Media Post Lookup** → [WhoPostedWhat](https://whopostedwhat.com/)
* 🖼️ **Image Forensics** → [FotoForensics](https://fotoforensics.com/)
* 🔍 **Reverse Image Search** → [TinEye](https://tineye.com/)
* 🧪 **Image Verification Assistant** → [MEVER Forensics](https://mever.iti.gr/forensics/)

## 📁 How It Works

Users interact with a simple HTML interface. When a content type is selected (or detected), they are automatically redirected to the corresponding analysis tool — **no manual selection required**.

## 🛠 Technologies

* HTML5
* JavaScript (Vanilla)

## 📦 Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the HTML file.
2. Open `index.html` in any browser.
3. Click on any button to simulate automatic redirection based on the type of content.

## ✅ Demo

> You can use this as a base and integrate file type detection or automatic classification as needed.
